# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION

📰 Fake News Detection
Fake News Detection is a machine learning project designed to identify and classify news articles as real or fake. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project ensures an efficient and accurate approach to combating misinformation.

🌟 Features
✨ Classifies news articles into real or fake.
🛠️ Preprocessed dataset for improved reliability.
📊 Implements NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
🚀 Supports various classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
🌐 Optional: Real-time news verification through a user-friendly web app.
